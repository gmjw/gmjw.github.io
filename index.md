Some pages discussing mathematical ideas I like

## The EM algorithm

The EM algorithm is a really clever way of optimising
our estimates of some parameters when we're faced with
both observed and hidden data.

I have a few notebooks explaining how the algorithm
can be derived and applied.

[Example 1: coin biases](https://gmjw.github.io/notebooks/em_algorithm_coin_example)

[Example 2: geyser eruptions](https://gmjw.github.io/notebooks/em_algorithm_gaussian_mixture) (not yet quite finished!)
